A chapel for the people to remind us that we are all the same. Its narrow wall can be seen from everywhere, so as the calling of the bell. When you reach the chapel there is more than just a wall… it\'s an art of seeing!\\nThe parvis of the chapel is the chapel\'s backyard, it is the reaching and gathering point, the first impression of the light and the surrounding. This place can be used for preaching in cases of a larger audience. It is defined by two walls that constrict at the preaching place to limit the view horizon, while the independent wall has openings to play with the shadow, the light, and nature.\\nSmall arcade openings lead you to the atrium of the chapel. Here, a rain bed welcomes the visitors allowing them to cherish the rainwater, its calming sound, and its purity. The nave is reached through doors made out of transparent wooden interlace. They can be closed when needed, but while open they offer you a ceremonial entry in the chapel… the place to pray, celebrate, cry, and to hope. A circular wall - the symbol of the self, the relationship between man and the whole nature, defines the presbytery, while more is left to the light. Every time the daylight makes the space and the atmosphere different. Light of faith comes from the back area of the sacristy.\\nLocal materials are used everywhere, bringing the atmosphere of the earth in each brick and in each wall layer. They offer an archaic, emotional, and intimate feeling of the place. The main walls are from rammed earth, while the other walls play with light and shadow with the absence of a brick. Pragmatic forms convey the chapel- square - the main geometry, with inner elements placed with a golden section. Simple, but with the power to embody the feeling of nostalgia, serenity, death, solitude, silence, beauty, myth, nature, and religion."}}},{"node":{"context":{"name":"Back to nature","category":["competitions","research"],"location":"/","year":2019,"status":"international competition-honorable mention","surface":null,"titleImage":"back-to-nature-2.jpg","images":["back-to-nature-1.jpg","back-to-nature-2.jpg"],"description":"The current way of life has become unhealthy for all living beings and destructive for the planet.

Reinforcing the idea of the Immeuble villas which had their own gardens, the new “building” will enclose an “empty” green space, filled with rooms (private spaces). The building can be a home for 1,\\n2 … 10 families, and will replace the classic building system in the classic urban block.\\nPeople will work from home, so the working space will be a must and the “after work” time will be mostly spent outside in the public spaces of the city. With that, the living room and the working space turn into a green oasis where people can spend most of the time in a direct connection with the outside. Every household grows its home greenery including food crops.\\nThe new kitchen includes new build-in modules for selected recycling. The process of product processing will now go through a full cycle.\\nThe consequences of such living will also be visible in the city functioning and programs - now the “Machines for living” will turn into “Green oasis for living and working” and the “collective living” will turn into “semi-public space”."}}},{"node":{"context":{"name":"Seduction pavillion","category":["competitions","interior design"],"location":"Bologna, Italy","year":2018,"status":"international competition","surface":null,"titleImage":"seduction-pavillion-0.jpg","images":["seduction-pavillion-1.jpg","seduction-pavillion-2.jpg","seduction-pavillion-3.jpg","seduction-pavillion-4.jpg","seduction-pavillion-5.jpg","seduction-pavillion-6.jpg","seduction-pavillion-7.jpg","seduction-pavillion-8.jpg"],"description":"The exhibition installation takes place at the entrance of the Foundation Fashion Research Italy, aiming to pay a tribute to the female beauties that have almost been part of the Hollywood and Italian star system but never achieved fame.

Frank Baum\\nPeople affected by conflict and other humanitarian crises say education is one of their top priorities, and for children, it is their top priority. Education provides physical and psychosocial protection that can save and sustain lives. Education should be available to everyone. In a crisis state of emergency, everything should be easily assembled, disassembled, and transformed.\\nEmergency means feasibility. A practical design should be simple and focused.\\n\'Education everywhere\' is a design for mobile school consisted of six trailers that can be transformed into a more complex educational facility. Four of the trailers are designed as fold-construction tents which can be open up to become two classrooms, a library, and a computer room. The classrooms can also be joined and used as one room, as well as a dormitory space during the night. The tents are easily assembled using the force of the vehicles. The other two trailers consist of toilets, a small kitchen, and a back-office room which is also used as storage when the school is being transported.

The flora and fauna of the oceans are projected to the walls showing the different organisms living in every one of the depth zones. The oceans are interconnected with a path that leads visitors through the permanent exhibition.

The walls of the house can spread or shrink at our will, but, the home is conceived as a concentrated being. It calls for a sense of centrality.\\nComing from a community where all the generations in the family live under the same roof, and the family is a priority, we envisioned the home as a balanced shape. Every activity is reflecting on its stability. It is easily thrown out of balance but always returns to its primary state. The focus point of the home is in the space where the family eats together and the food is prepared. Three generations of people gather here. Climbing the stairs we go to the higher points of the home where individual spaces appear, shaped by the needs and wishes of the people who inhabit them. They are the places of solitude and silence, used mainly for sleeping. These spaces are distributed spirally around a vertical axis. As time passes by, the old generations are replaced by the new and they take their place in the home hierarchy.\\nThe human being is a spiral, a defocused being. It is no longer clear whether it runs towards the center or is running out.\\nThe key to harmony is synergy and mutual support.

The stripe that meanders and adapts to the ground becomes dramatic as the terrain itself, which imitates the way of building of the old fortress where each wall follows the natural shape of the rock, forming different platforms with a beautiful view. The gesture starts at the edge of the old town and ends with a tower that interprets the old tower which collapsed in 1940. An inner street connects the programs from the entrance of the building and at some points it opens to the outside and leads to the external extensions such as: observatory swimming pool, observatory amphitheater and various platforms for observing the landscape or camping. Curiosity for exploring and the feeling of mystery are awaken with the play of light and shadows. The promenade culminates in a tower which contains a water collector with an observation telescope at the top and is connected to the fortress with a folding bridge. The houses are places of solitude and daydreaming, representing observatories on their own way.
