People became antisocial and have less connection with nature.\nIt is time for a new era, new movement, a sustainable future where some rules are a MUST. People should learn how to respect the nature and the resources by practicing the process of their production. It is time for everybody to produce their own energy, recycle the water and the waste they create, produce, and grow the food they eat.\nSuch rules for sustainable future, demand a new way of dwelling, another housing concept that will also affect strongly on the social aspect of the humans and their city of tomorrow. Reinforcing the idea of the Immeuble villas which had their own gardens, the new “building” will enclose an “empty” green space, filled with rooms (private spaces). The building can be a home for 1,\n2 … 10 families, and will replace the classic building system in the classic urban block.\nPeople will work from home, so the working space will be a must and the “after work” time will be mostly spent outside in the public spaces of the city. With that, the living room and the working space turn into a green oasis where people can spend most of the time in a direct connection with the outside. Every household grows its home greenery including food crops.\nThe new kitchen includes new build-in modules for selected recycling. The process of product processing will now go through a full cycle.\nThe consequences of such living will also be visible in the city functioning and programs - now the “Machines for living” will turn into “Green oasis for living and working” and the “collective living” will turn into “semi-public space”."}}},{"node":{"context":{"name":"Education everywhere","category":["competitions","research"],"location":"/","year":2018,"status":"international competition-1st place","surface":null,"titleImage":"education-everywhere-0.jpg","images":["education-everywhere-1.jpg","education-everywhere-2.jpg","education-everywhere-3.jpg"],"description":"'No thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure to acquire.' – L. Frank Baum\nPeople affected by conflict and other humanitarian crises say education is one of their top priorities, and for children, it is their top priority. Education provides physical and psychosocial protection that can save and sustain lives. Education should be available to everyone. In a crisis state of emergency, everything should be easily assembled, disassembled, and transformed.\nEmergency means feasibility. A practical design should be simple and focused.\n'Education everywhere' is a design for mobile school consisted of six trailers that can be transformed into a more complex educational facility. Four of the trailers are designed as fold-construction tents which can be open up to become two classrooms, a library, and a computer room. The classrooms can also be joined and used as one room, as well as a dormitory space during the night. The tents are easily assembled using the force of the vehicles. The other two trailers consist of toilets, a small kitchen, and a back-office room which is also used as storage when the school is being transported. This kind of design offers a very flexible spatial composition that can be used in a variety of situations."}}},{"node":{"context":{"name":"The touch","category":["competitions","research"],"location":"Algarve coast, Portugal","year":2018,"status":"international competition-2nd place","surface":null,"titleImage":"the-touch-0.jpg","images":["the-touch-1.jpg","the-touch-2.jpg"],"description":"The Algarve Coast in Portugal, a perfect natural observatory and border between the two main surfaces of our planet, the sea, and the earth. The two vital elements that offer us life, but suffer from our detrimental behavior.\nOn the edge of this landscape observatory stands an ultimate united sculpture as a point of awareness, that connects these two surfaces. It is the Sea Museum, a lighthouse that can be seen from any point of view around this coast, but still makes you wonder about its hidden ability to lighten up your mind. This Sea Museum offers visitors a communication and experience with the Sea World, with a mission to make changes for a better place on planet Earth.\nThe hidden spaces underneath the earth represent the five Oceans showing their own unique natural characteristics, and their dark polluted side caused by the Human factor. Each ocean is represented by a space with different ceiling height and temperature fluctuations. The flora and fauna of the oceans are projected to the walls showing the different organisms living in every one of the depth zones. The oceans are interconnected with a path that leads visitors through the permanent exhibition. The ceiling of this representation of the oceans is a platform that is used for the temporary exhibition – the pollution problems. This way the visitors’ perfect trip to the undersea fades under the plastic trash floating above their heads. How to better show the problem than try to represent the reality? This is a temporary exhibition we all hope will not last for long!"}}},{"node":{"context":{"name":"State of balance","category":["competitions","research"],"location":"Kichevo, North Macedonia","year":2017,"status":"international competition-honorable mention","surface":null,"titleImage":"state-of-balance-0.jpg","images":["state-of-balance-1.jpg","state-of-balance-2.jpg"],"description":"Anchoring our identity is a need. To remember who we are, we need to get home. Creating our home is one of the most meaningful activities we are ever engaged in.\nIn every dream of a house, there is a possibility for a huge cosmic house that allows us to daydream and to populate the Universe. The walls of the house can spread or shrink at our will, but, the home is conceived as a concentrated being. It calls for a sense of centrality.\nComing from a community where all the generations in the family live under the same roof, and the family is a priority, we envisioned the home as a balanced shape. Every activity is reflecting on its stability. It is easily thrown out of balance but always returns to its primary state. The focus point of the home is in the space where the family eats together and the food is prepared. Three generations of people gather here. Climbing the stairs we go to the higher points of the home where individual spaces appear, shaped by the needs and wishes of the people who inhabit them. They are the places of solitude and silence, used mainly for sleeping. These spaces are distributed spirally around a vertical axis. As time passes by, the old generations are replaced by the new and they take their place in the home hierarchy.\nThe human being is a spiral, a defocused being. It is no longer clear whether it runs towards the center or is running out.\nThe key to harmony is synergy and mutual support. One can go out and explore the world but is always dependent on the stability the home offers. When difficult times occur and the home is shaken out of balance, the focal point of the 'shape', the place where the family can gather is where the turmoil is the smallest and most endurable."}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
